USAGE 
----- 
idrive-wrapper [OPTIONS [ARGUMENTS]] [IDRIVE_USERID]

[OPTIONS [ARGUMENTS]] 
-u
Upload to IDrive. The list of files and folders are taken from UPLOAD_LIST key value from the config file. If no file/folders are given then program will not do any uploads. A parent directory can be provided using 
the -P option else in IDRIVE_HOME_FOLDER key value in config file and the uploads will happen relative to this directory in IDrive. If a valid path is provided in ACL_BACKUP then program will backup the ACL 
information for the files/folders included in current upload run. For more information on ACL_BACKUP refer to the config section.

-U ARG
Upload to IDrive the files/folders given as the argument. Requires a mandatory argument which should contain comma separated paths of files and folders to be uploaded. The parent directory will be taken from the -P 
option or from the config file value for IDRIVE_HOME_FOLDER. If a valid path is provided in ACL_BACKUP then program will backup the ACL information for the files/folders included in current upload run. For more 
information on ACL_BACKUP refer to the config section.

-P ARG
IDrive home folder. Requires a mandatory argument which should be the parent folder in IDrive. This will have precedence over the value given in IDRIVE_HOME_FOLDER key in the config file. If no other option is used
along with this then the program will print the IDrive server address and exit.

-d
Delete from IDrive. The list of files and folders are taken from DELETE_LIST key value from the config file. If no file/folders are given then program will not do any deletion.

-D ARG
Delete from IDrive the file/folders given as argument. Requires a mandatory argument which should contain comma separated paths of file and folders in IDrive which need to be delete.

-g ARG
Get/download files/folders from IDrive. Requires a mandatory argument containing valid comma separated paths in IDrive.  The files and folders mentioned will be downloaded. To specify a download location use -G option.
If no -G option is used then the files will be downloaded to /tmp/idrive-downloads/. IDrive does not store the file metadata info like permissions/owner/group. The ACL_BACKUP config option can be used while uploading and
same can be used to restore this metadata. For more information on ACL_BACKUP refer to the config section.

-G ARG
Download location. Is valid only if used with -g and requires a mandatory argument. Should specify one valid directory path to which the files/folders mentioned in -g option will be downloaded to.

-l ARG
List or search for files and folders in IDrive. Requires a mandatory argument. If the path provided exists in IDrive the contents of the folder will be listed or if a file then the file info will be listed. If not then
info for all matching instances of given search term will be listed.

-L
List the contents of the IDrive home folder. The home folder is set using -P option or from the config file for key IDRIVE_HOME_FOLDER.

-V ARG
Versioning info for a file. Requires a mandatory argument. If the provided path is a valid for a file in IDrive and there are multiple versions of the file stored then this information will be displayed.

-p ARG
File/Folder properties. Requires a mandatory argument. If the provided path if valid for a file or folder in IDrive then the file/folder property info will be shown.

-s
Show the space usage in IDrive root. Shows total and used space. For individual file/folder size use the -p option.

-v
Displays the current version of the idrive-wrapper program and the version of installed idevsutil program.

-o ARG
Log file. Requires a mandatory argument to which the log entries will be written to in append mode. File will be created if it does not exist. IF path is invalid or there is no write access then no logs will be written.
Output to terminal will happen irrespective of if a log file has been specified for or not.

-h
Displays this help file.

[IDRIVE_USERID]
The user ID to login to IDrive can be provided in the command line. This will override what is given in the config file for UNAME key value. If run only with USERID and without any above options the program will display
server used for backup and exit.

CONFIG FILE 
----------- 
The config file should be available at ~/.config/.idriverc. This a key value pair file. A template file with the available keys is present in /usr/share/doc/idrive-wrapper/. 
This file can contain the below keys:

UNAME
The user ID registered with IDrive. Single value. If provided in command line then that value takes precedence. If not provided at either place then program will exit.

UPLOAD_LIST
A comma separated list of file and folder paths to be uploaded to IDrive. Absolute paths are preferred. If not given then the upload operation will not proceed. Upload into IDrive will be done relative to parent folder
given IDRIVE_HOME_FOLDER key.

DELETE_LIST
A comma separated list of file and folder paths to be delete from IDrive. Paths should be corresponding to IDrive root. If not given then the delete operation will not proceed.

IDRIVE_HOME_FOLDER
This will be the parent folder to which the data for upload will be uploaded with both -u and -U options. If not given the system will default to IDrive root folder. This will also be used with -L option.

ACL_BACKUP
Path to which the ACL info for the current list of files/folders being uploaded should be saved. This should be a valid path(program will not create it). If not valid or not provided then no ACL backup will be taken. A
new file is created for every upload run and has the timestamp in the filename. Same file will be used for one execution when both -u and -U options are given. IDrive does not save file metadata like 
permissions/owner/group. So as part of restore, after downloading required data from IDrive this ACL backup file can be used to restore the metadata. The path in the backup file will have to be changed to reflect the 
download location. It is recommended to include this ACL backup directory in your list of folders to be backed up. getfacl is used to backup the ACLs and should be available in the system for backup to work. setfacl can 
be used to restore them. Refer to 'man setfacl' for more information.

EXAMPLES
--------
$ idrive-wrapper -u
This will upload files from the config file

$ idrive-wrapper -D /ArchLinux/home/usr1/Documents/sample.txt,/ArchLinux/tmp/test/ usr1.abc@provider.com
This will move the file /ArchLinux/home/usr1/Documents/sample.txt and the folder /ArchLinux/tmp/test/ in IDrive to the trash. The user used for authentication will be usr1.abc@provider.com.

$ idrive-wrapper -g /ArchLinux/home/usr1/ -G /home/usr1/fromcloud/
This will download the contents of /ArchLinux/home/usr1/ from IDrive into /home/usr1/fromcloud/ in your local machine

SECURITY INFO
